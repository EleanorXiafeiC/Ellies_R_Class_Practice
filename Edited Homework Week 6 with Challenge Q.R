#/Required problem 0: Using the parsing functions you wrote last week, parse your own data logger data into a data frame that is in the merged format at the end of the Week 4 assignment.This data frame should be 16 columns and about 20k rows (1 sample/minute * 14 days). Using the write.csv() function, write this merged data frame out to a CSV file named{first_name}_{last_name}.csv (for example danny_wilson.csv).

#/Question 8 Look at the result of the cooking algorithm plotted in problem 7. Does it look right to you? What is it doing wrong? What could be improved? What clues do the temperature and humidity traces tell you about the start and stop of cooking events? Write a narrative description of how an improved cooking event detection algorithm would work? What would you do to detect cooking from start to stop more accurately? 

#/I think it looks a bit weird with the huge dip in humidity over the giant spike in temperature.  That seems a bit odd to me. I don't know what it might be doing wrong.  How would I improve it? I might set another threshold for the humidity value to more closely match with the cooking value. I would also figure out a way to detect peak heat and then anything less than that would be marked "non-cooking." Some friends told me to try to use the Delta of temp but I wouldn't know how to express that mathematically in a way the computer could read. Also I don't trust that I have any intuition on how a cooking graph should look. Instead of temperature and humidity on an electric stove, I might try to find a way to measure when the electricity is turned on and off.  I suppose this method makes more sense for a gas stove though.

#/Challenge question:
